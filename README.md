# Microsoft Entra ID MFA/SSPR PreFillinator

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:**

> This is a work-in-progress.

Pre-fill/pre-populate a mobile phone number and/or email address for users, in your ~~Azure AD~~ Entra ID directory, to use with MFA and/or self-service password reset (SSPR).

## ü§î How it works

Instead of populating the mobile phone number and other emails attributes, this will use the Microsoft Graph API endpoints for managing both the [Phone](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/phoneauthenticationmethod?view=graph-rest-1.0) and [Email](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/emailauthenticationmethod?view=graph-rest-1.0) authentication methods for users. This prevents their personal phone number or email address from being visible to everyone.

It can be invoked either through:

* A message being dropped into an Azure Storage Queue.
* A HTTP POST request to `/api/authenticationMethods`.

This is a sample JSON document to use for both an Azure Storage Queue message or in a HTTP POST request body:

```json
{
    "userPrincipalName": "jeff.winger@greendalecc.edu",
    "emailAddress": "tangolawyer10@gmail.com",
    "phoneNumber": "+1 5555555555"
}
```
